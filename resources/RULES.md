# Server Rules
## 1\. Don't be a jerk
The golden rule. Nobody likes trolls and obnoxious people.
- No spam, no advertisement, no NSFW content.
- Keep excessive controversial topics to yourself.
- We are not interested in drama you bring into here from other spaces.
- Be helpful. Point people into the right direction instead of talking down on them.
## 2\. Please keep chat and questions in English
This is an international community. English is the common ground people agreed on, not just in programming.
- You don't need to speak it perfectly, many of us aren't native speakers either! Just take your time and try your best!
## 3\. We expect a solid understanding of JavaScript
If you are new to developing with JavaScript and Node.js, please take some time to familiarize yourself with basic language concepts.
- This helps you understand the answers people are giving to your questions.
- You can find some curated online resources in %RESOURCES_CHANNEL%!
- We will gladly point you in the right direction, but you will have to put in some work yourself.
## 4\. Please ask questions in the relevant channels
Stick to one appropriate channel per question. Do not ask people to answer you in different channels.
- If you are new to technical questions and the server, check out %GET_HELP_CHANNEL%!
- Please keep discord.js related help channels to questions about using discord.js.
- Using something in context of a Discord bot does not mean the question is about using discord.js itself.
## 5\. Do not randomly mention or direct message individual members
If you post your question in a public channel more people can see it and you will likely get your answer quicker.
## 6\. Use readable display names
We understand that display names are a nice way to express yourself. Please consider other users viewing the channel, though!
- Your name should be easy to read.
- Your name should be easy to mention and refer to.
- Your name should not take up a lot of screen space.

## Contacting Moderators
You can use %COMMAND_REPORT_USER% and %COMMAND_REPORT_MESSAGE% to contact server moderators quietly *(both are also available as right-click commands)*
- If a situation needs urgent moderator attention, mention the %MENTION_MODS% role instead of individual people!
- Note that creating false reports may lead to moderation actions against you.
